## Installation

You can install Termish directly using a single command. However, the installation method depends on your shell:

### For Bash or Zsh
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gourdian25/termish/master/install.sh | sh
```

### For Fish Shell
Fish shell requires explicit use of `bash` to interpret the script. Run:

```fish
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gourdian25/termish/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation
If the above methods don't work, you can manually download and install Termish:

1. Download the script:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gourdian25/termish/master/install.sh -o install.sh
   ```

2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

This script will:
1. Download the latest version of Termish.

3. Place it in a directory included in your `$PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).
4. Install the fortune and cowsay dependencies if they're not already installed.
